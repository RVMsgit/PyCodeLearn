#Commenting does not run in the console
#With comments there is no output

#Comments are useful to explain your code
#Example; when adding double quotes instead of single quotes beacause the print statement uses single
print("It's a small world after all") #It's is written with ' therefore we use double quotes

#We can use commenting for debbuging script
#To comment a line: ctrl + k + c
#To uncomment a line of code: ctrl + k + u
